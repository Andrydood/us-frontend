## Intro
It's Us is an online community designed to present creative projects and find skilled collaborators.

In other words, it is a platform designed for 2 situations:

1. A place where individuals that aren't currently working on a project but would like to can find new endevours to hone their skills and have fun.
2. A place where individuals that have an idea for a project need other creative collaborators to help out.

The platform allows users to create an account and browse existing projects as well as create their own.
There is an integrated chat platform where interested users can contact project owners and the two can start working together.

## Further info

The web app is written in react/redux using express

To use it, you need a google maps API key that needs to be placed as indicated in `_app.js`.

To then test the app, install the required modules, spin up the [back end](http://github.com/andrydood/us-backend) and run with `yarn dev`
